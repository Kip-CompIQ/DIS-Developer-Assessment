# Background

This is a technical assessment meant to provide an opportunity for you
to demonstrate your skills as it relates to the varied tasks here at
CompIQ. You should spend no more than 2 hours on the assessment. If you
cannot complete a requirement due to time, please provide a short
response indicating how you would address the requirement.

# Summary

You are a developer at CompIQ and are tasked with implementing a Fugazi
File importer.

Fugazi files are flat-files, meaning that each row of a Fugazi file
represents a record, and their file ending is `.fgz`. The data within
that record is contained in the row and is separated by spaces.

Fugazi File Specification:

  Name          Nice Name      Start   Length   Data Type   Notes
  ------------- -------------- ------- -------- ----------- -------------------------------------------
  patientName   Patient Name   0       25       string      
  address       Address        25      50       string      
  phoneNumber   Phone Number   75      10       int         No dashes
  injury        Injury         85      30       string      Description of injury
  treatment     Treatment      115     30       string      Description of treatment
  amount        Amount         145     15       decimal     Cost of the claim in USD
  status        Status         160     10       string      Whether the claim was approved or denied.

An example record could look like this:

`John Cena                123 Internet Street                               5555555555Torn Bicep                    Surgery                       100           Denied`

Which represented as JSON using the above mapping, this record would
look like this:

``` javascript
{
    "patientName":"John Cena",
    "address":"123 Internet Street",
    "phoneNumber":5555555555,
    "injury":"Torn Bicep",
    "treatment":"Surgery",
    "amount":100,
    "status":"Denied"
}
```

The importer you\'ll design will need to import these Fugazi files via
an API to the `FugaziImport` table of an sqLite database with the
following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE "FugaziImport" (
    "Id"    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "PatientName"   TEXT NOT NULL,
    "Address"   TEXT,
    "PhoneNumber"   INTEGER,
    "Injury"    TEXT,
    "Treatment" INTEGER,
    "Amount"    NUMERIC,
    "Status"    TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY("Id" AUTOINCREMENT)
);
```

Additionally, your api will need to return information about the Fugazi
files.

# Requirements

This assessment can be completed with any language or framework you so
choose. A dotnet starter project is included in the repository if you
are so inclined in the `/dotnet6` directory. Sample `.fgz` files can be
found in the `/sample` directory and the sqLite db is in the `/db`
directory. Feel free to create whatever additional tables in the db you
may need, but you must maintain the structure of the FugaziImport table.

## API Endpoints

-   [ ] POST `/upload` Imports a Fugazi file received through a
    multipart form upload
-   [ ] GET `/fugazi` Returns a JSON formatted list of all imported
    Fugazi records in the database
-   [ ] GET `/fugazi/{id}` Returns a specific imported Fugazi record in
    JSON format with the id of `{id}`. E.g. `/fugazi/1` should return
    the Fugazi record with an id of 1.

## Documentation

-   [ ] Running Locally Complete the section `Running Locally` below
    describing how another developer would run your code
-   [ ] Deploying to Production Complete the section
    `Deploying to Production` below describing how to deploy your code
    to production

# Bonus Points

These are not at all required for submission, but are nice to see. If
you run out time or have ideas, please describe them.

-   [ ] UI of some sort
-   [ ] API can generate Fugazi files from a selection of records
-   [ ] Large file handling
